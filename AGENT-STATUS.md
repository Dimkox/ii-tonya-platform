# Agent status — owner-spec 2026-09-16

Updated: 2026-09-16 after squash-merge to main. This is the live continuation
file. Read it before `AGENTS.md` extras, the spec README, or any TASK card. Do
not treat older handoffs (`docs/handoffs/2026-08-*`) as current.

**Do not print, commit, or paste `.env` values.** Names of variables only.

## Where you are

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Canonical checkout | `/home/pall/projects/ii-tonya-base/work/ii-tonya-platform` on `main` |
| `main` SHA | `b2b7af9c` = squash of PR [#89](https://github.com/Dimkox/ii-tonya-platform/pull/89), on top of `92993646` (PR #88) |
| Feature branch | `codex/owner-spec-2026-09-16` still exists locally in `.worktrees/owner-spec-2026-09-16` (not deleted; `main` was already checked out in the primary worktree) |
| Copy-guard follow-up | PR [#89](https://github.com/Dimkox/ii-tonya-platform/pull/89) squash-merged to `main` as `b2b7af9c`; branch `codex/copy-guard-warnings-2026-09-16` deleted (local and remote) |
| Copy-guard pre-squash tip | `b6215e8` (history rewritten by squash; use `92993646` on main) |
| Spec package | `_bmad-output/specs/spec-owner-update-2026-09-16/` |
| Local secrets | `/home/pall/projects/ii-tonya-base/work/ii-tonya-platform/.env`, mode `0600`, gitignored |

Continue new work from **`main` at `b2b7af9c`**, not from the old feature-branch SHAs.

## What is done

### TASK-EXP-001 copy guard (code)

State on the card: `implemented_pending_review`. Live activation is **not** in scope.

- `guardClientCopy` in `packages/domain/src/safety.ts`.
- Wired in `conversation-service.ts` (`kind === "answer"`) and in `decodeProviderTextProposal` (`selarti_response_copy_prohibited` → `rejected` before `proposals.accept`).
- Public brand markup is `<span>ии-</span>Тоня` with `.brand { gap: 0 }` in landing and legal views.
- Commits: `5eab17e` (guard), `0bae85a` (brand + provider ingress + negation/brand/normalize), `b6215e8` (word forms). Follow-up warning triage: `f7a899c` on `codex/copy-guard-warnings-2026-09-16`.

Focused tests after `b6215e8`: prompt-safety 121, selarti-response-service 17, client-copy-guard + web 35, conversation-service 66, domain 67.

Independent re-review after `b6215e8`: **no remaining Critical**. Follow-up `f7a899c` triages the
Warnings; a second independent review of that commit caught three false positives (`перебираю`
rejected, `оформляет … сегодня` rejected, the disclaimer word-order break) and those edits were
reverted / narrowed. Closed in `f7a899c`:

- Marketing word forms — наилучший, скидочный, выгоднейший, сэкономите, успевайте, порекомендуем —
  each as a targeted variant, no word boundary loosened.
- Format chars beyond ZWSP/soft-hyphen — LRM/RLM and the bidi embedding/override/isolate controls
  are stripped before matching.
- Pressure singular imperative «оформи сегодня» via whole-word `оформ(?:ите|и)`, so
  `оформляет`/`оформить`/`оформление` stay neutral.

Still open as accepted-by-design Warnings (a naive fix rejects approved copy — see commit body):

- Negation after-window: «Поставлю диагноз вам точно не сразу» still accepted — a distance rule
  cannot separate it from the protected «Диагноз по переписке не ставлю».
- «перебью» still accepted — widening `перебива*` also rejects «перебираю варианты/слоты».
- Homoglyphs (`лyчшие`) and landing «диагностика» were left on purpose.

Rebuild domain dist with tsup before tests that import `@ii-tonya/domain` (vitest does not alias it to source).

### Selarti credentials (local env only)

Auth against `POST https://selarti.com/api/1.1/wf/auth` with `{"key":"<SELARTI_API_KEY>"}` now works (earlier the key was accidentally equal to `SELARTI_COMPANY_ID` and failed `NO_EMAIL`).

Set in the **main-checkout** `.env` (not this worktree):

| Variable | State |
|---|---|
| `SELARTI_API_KEY` | set (50 chars, not a Bubble id) |
| `SELARTI_COMPANY_ID` | set |
| `SELARTI_TASK_ID` | set — task name `test expert`, type Telegram, status in progress |
| `SELARTI_AI_ID` | set — **new** agent created via `POST /api/1.1/wf/create_ai`, name `ии-Тоня`, version `gpt-4o`, work option `incoming and outgoing communication` |
| `SELARTI_ENABLED` | **false** |
| `SELARTI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | placeholder |

`create_ai` docs: [Selarti public API](https://docs.selarti.com/), body fields `company_id`, `name`, `start_message`, `version`, `work_option`, `instruction`. Meta: `GET https://selarti.com/api/1.1/meta`.

The task `test expert` still points at the older agent `41nano` (`gpt-4.1-nano`). The new `ии-Тоня` agent is **not** bound to that task. Do not call `update_task` or enable flags without an explicit owner ask.

## What is blocked / not done

1. ~~Formal close of TASK-EXP-001 review checkbox; optional Warning pass.~~ Done: safe Warnings
   fixed and review checkbox closed on `codex/copy-guard-warnings-2026-09-16`, squash-merged to
   `main` as `b2b7af9c` (PR #89). Two accepted-by-design Warnings remain (see copy-guard section).
2. Bind `ии-Тоня` AI to a task if that is wanted (currently `test expert` → `41nano`).
3. Selarti live path: webhook URL + `SELARTI_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, channel mapping, `SELARTI_RESPONSE_INGRESS_*` (absent from the working `.env`; only in `.env.example`), cost admission, `selarti_ai_processing` consent. Keep `SELARTI_ENABLED=false` until that is asked.
4. ~~Push of the local commits.~~ Done: PR #88 squash-merged to `main` as `92993646`.
5. Owner DEC pack (23 P0 cards) still holds FIN/PLT implementation. Decision sheet: `/home/pall/projects/ii-tonya-base/outputs/owner-decision-sheet-2026-09-16.md`.
6. Planerka / Make / Sheets still placeholders. Telegram bot tokens exist; webhook/HMAC/admin chat ids do not. YooKassa key exists; `PAYMENTS_ENABLED=false`.

## Next actions (pick one, do not mix)

- **Copy-guard:** ~~fix remaining Warnings~~ done and merged (PR #89 → `b2b7af9c`). The two
  accepted-by-design Warnings above (negation timing-hedge, `перебью`) stay open unless the owner
  expands the card; a POS-style fix is the only safe way to close them.
- **Selarti wiring:** bind AI to task / add webhook secret and receiver — only if the owner asks; do not flip `SELARTI_ENABLED`.
- **Owner decisions:** walk the 23 DEC cards; do not invent variants.
- **Publish:** ~~push the feature branch.~~ Merged. Further work is a new `codex/*` branch from current `main`.

## Standing rules for this branch

- Node 24, pnpm 11.9.0, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, no `drizzle-kit generate`.
- External capabilities default-off. This branch does not authorize deploy, production enablement, or secret rotation into git.
- After editing `packages/domain/src/**`, run tsup on that package before focused vitest of `@ii-tonya/domain` importers.
- Spec contract: `_bmad-output/specs/spec-owner-update-2026-09-16/execution-contract.md`.
